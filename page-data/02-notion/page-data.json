This was particularly annoying when I for example wanted to keep track of different due dates of different classes in university.\\nI had to use one calendar for each class and check each calendar frequently.\\nThis got quite annoying quite fast and I switched promptly back to google calendar for this kind of task.\\nThis was of course until I learned about the glorious linked databases! They solved my problem completely and I was able to share one calendar between multible pages!\\nSo how do linked databases work?\\nEssentially its just one single database that can be used in different workspaces where changes in one workspace affect the other one.\\nCreating a linked database is quite easy, just go to the page where you want to create one and type the command just like in the picture below.\\nThere you can choose which database you want to link to.\\n\", mdx(\"img\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"src\": \"linked-database.png\",\n    \"alt\": \"linked-database\"\n  }), \"\\nOf course we have to have an original database first before we can link to it.\\nWhen creating a linked database, you will notice that it is not formatted properly and does not use the full width of the page.\\nIn order to fix this you have to go to the settings on the top right and enable the option 'full-width'.\\n\", mdx(\"img\", {\n    parentName: \"p\",\n    \"src\": \"full-width.png\",\n    \"alt\": \"full-width\"\n  })), mdx(\"h2\", {\n    \"id\": \"a-simple-example\"\n  }, \"A simple example\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So what now?

All of our entries in our university page will have a Tag named \\\"University\\\".\\nAfter doing all this, there is one final step: We must create a new View and add a filter to this view in order to only show entries with the proper tag.\\nCreating a new view is quite simple as you can see on the screenshot below.
