Aelius FÃ¶rderwerk released a podcast episode where they interviewed me about my personal history. They are a non-profit-organisation dedicated to foster the education of kids independent of social background or performance. It was fun to record this episode with them and their ideals inspired me to further work with them. So stay tuned ;)
